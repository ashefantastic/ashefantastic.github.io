Good Question. I love hardware. I mean I LOVVVE hardware. I have spent many a night at the end of some random hallway in a datacenter surrounded by the hum of the server fans. It was bliss. However, slowly over time I began to wonder how the software these servers was put together. I wanted to understand the process. So I started to teach myself how to code. At first it was a daunting task. 15 years ago there were no real places to go where you would  have a community of people who love to code helping others that were trying to get on board the train . Normally this would make someone just give up. The struggle just made it more rewarding when I finally got the simplest of programs to work. For me it was when I finally got my head around how to do a for loop. So in short that is why and how I got into wanting to learn software development.
